This branch is for MSDP based plugins. 

To get this working in your MUSHclient:

   Download:   - My_Chat_Window.lua
               - MSDPHanlder.xml
               - MSDPHelper.lua
               - colours.lua
   
   Download any of the other .xml plugin files

Put them in the MUSHclient -> Worlds -> Plugins folder

install them via file - plugins in MUSHclient! 


Have fun!
